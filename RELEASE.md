# Eclipse Che Configbump release process

Use "Release Che Configbump" workflow for release, which can be triggered manually on GitHub page of the repository at Actions -> "Release Che Configbump" -> "Run workflow"

Normally this workflow will be triggered as part of a Che release - see https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-release/actions/workflows/release-orchestrate-overall.yml
